## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for MongODM. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/Etherna/etherna/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [issue search](https://etherna.atlassian.net/browse/MODM)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as issues on our [Jira site](https://etherna.atlassian.net/). After you've determined which project your bug is related to, create an issue on it.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you configured the service or how you are integrating the library, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or environment details.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Jira code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that service or library crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of service/tool) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type, with large files, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of service/tool are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**
* **Are you running service/tool in a virtual machine or Docker container?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which additional packages do you have installed?**

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Include the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.**
* **Perform a [issue search](https://etherna.atlassian.net/browse/MODM)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as issues on our [Jira site](https://etherna.atlassian.net/). After you've determined which project your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on it and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as code blocks.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most service/tool users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as an external package.
* **Specify which version of software you're using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

## Styleguides

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
